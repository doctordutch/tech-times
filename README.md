## Description

This project will be a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. This site will be built completely from scratch and deployed to Heroku. This app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.


Below is the defined `User Story` for this application:

```
AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions
```

## Features
This is a CMS-style blog site, with basic features such as:
* Homepage displaying list of existing posts
* A dynamic navigation bar that changes depending on whether user is logged in or not. 
* Login and signup capabilities (Signing up requires the user to input an email address, username and password. Credentials are then saved and they are automatically logged into the site).
* Users can click on any post to view the entirety of the post, including any associated comments.
* Users are required to be signed up AND logged in, in order to add posts and comments.
* If they are logged in, users have the ability to update and delete any posts they own. 
* An auto-logout function (a.k.a. session expiry) will occur if the user is idle for 24 hours.

## Installation
This application has been deployed to Heroku.
